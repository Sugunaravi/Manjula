# Hi👋🏼,I'm Manjula
  
   Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a recent  Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate with a strong passion for working in my core domain. I'm eager to apply my academic knowledge and hands-on skills in real-world projects, especially in areas related to electronics, embedded systems, and the growing field of electric vehicle (EV).I have also completed a training in EV Technology,which enhanced my understanding of battery systems, power electronics and motor control.
Currently exploring opportunities to grow and contribute as a core engineer.Feel free to check out my projects and learning journey!
